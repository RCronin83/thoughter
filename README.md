Front end testing requires us to also account for DOM manipulation and Ajax calls. This assignment will give us some practice writing asynchronous tests and ones that require a specific piece of HTML to execute. By the end of this assignment you should understand the basics of setting up an HTML fixture for a test and using a fake server for Ajax testing.
